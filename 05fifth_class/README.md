# Clusterization

In this lesson we learned about Clusterization, we saw the main concepts such as the elbow method that defines how many clusters are appropriate for model training and we applied what we learned in the famous dataset "Iris Species" that have three types of flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica);

We used two versions of K-Means, in the notebook "K-means_Random.ipynb" we started it randomly (init = ‘random') and in the notebook "clustering_with_k-means++.ipynb" we use k-means++ (init = ‘k-means++');

With the elbow method graph, it is noticeable that the method is actually effective, as it indicated that the ideal number of clusters would be 3 (there are 3 types of flower species in the dataset). We chose 3 because from it the curve begins to stabilize;

We accomplished the visualization of the centroids and finally, the visualization of the clusters was accomplished.
